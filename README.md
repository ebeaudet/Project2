# SMEL.ly Trivia

Smel.ly trivia is a trivia game that you can play either on your own, or go head to head with up to 4 total players! 
Four trivia categories are randomly selected from a pool of 32 different categories, with scaling difficulties and point 
values in each of those categories. 

* Learn something new every time you play AND have fun doing it!

* Why go to a bar? Now you can create Trivia nights with your friends in the comfort of your own home!!

* Lots of  trivia games are riddled with extra clicks, ads, and all kinds of nonsense. We just wanted a clean and simple interface for answering some trivia questions.  

* Smel.ly is fast and reliable, capable of generating unique API calls on the fly without slowing down the game.  

* Do you SMEL good? Letâ€™s find out.
